<!-- The var() function in CSS is used to define and use custom CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties. These
variables allow you to store and reuse values throughout your CSS code, providing more flexibility and maintainability
for your styles. The primary purposes of using the var() function in CSS are:

Reusability: You can define a value in one place and use it in multiple locations throughout your CSS. This makes it
easy to maintain and update styles across your entire website or application by modifying the value in just one place
(the variable definition).

Consistency: Using CSS variables helps maintain design consistency. For example, you can define variables for colors,
typography settings, spacing, or other design elements. This ensures that you use the same colors, font sizes, or 
spacing throughout your site, which can improve the overall look and feel.

Theming: CSS variables are particularly useful for theming or creating different visual styles for your website or 
application. By changing the values of CSS variables, you can easily switch between different themes or styles without
needing to rewrite your entire CSS.
